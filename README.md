# CIE-staff-allotment

An automated system which can allot invigilators to classrooms during an examination made using python flask


The proposed scheme will automate the manual exam management process by introducing a web
based application which uses an efficient algorithm for scheduling the exam duties. Comprehensive
testing and validation process is carried out to make application handle events which may result in
the invalid data or invalid actions by the user. Overall the results obtained justify the suitability and
quality of application for organisational needs.
